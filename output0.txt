At this stage I've allinone.R 
includes all the code
snpgdsLDpruning() showed itself to not really obey the nu,.tread-4
as each time I went into htop there was only 1 R running.
In any case it still took about 80 minutes to get to that part.

here is a decent extract of the console output

this then appeared to be genuinely using parallelism instead of merely just saying so.
it also reports back stuff like
